# gm_playerload
Simple module that adds a hook for when a player fully loads

## Overview
According to [this issue](https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod-requests/issues/718) on the Garry's Mod issues net messages become unreliable and will likely crash players games when sent to a spawning player. To work around this a few smart people came up with a workaround and this is our rendition of it, not too different from the actual workaround but it fits our styling needs and it is easy to implement to our servers when needed.

## Installation
Clone or download this repository into your `garrysmod/addons` folder and restart your server or game.
